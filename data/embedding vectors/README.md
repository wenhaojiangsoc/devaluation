Embedding vectors I trained using word2vec (*gensim 4.3.0*) by decade for Google Ngram and COHA and COCA (combined as COCHA). Due to the file size limit, the embeddings are uploaded to the dropbox folder [COCHA](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/53zl0zwrnowpb4zqa9em8/COCHA.zip?rlkey=snsc07jo3bjfmk0u9mauvkd04&st=zffvsmn1&dl=0) and [Ngram](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wtrhnrywb5xpj0zepzvn1/Ngram.zip?rlkey=5t21hczhojakse4zgkzn511yh&st=qd29mwc5&dl=0).
